OpenCV optical flow control project for parrot drones

This is a work in progress project for my master's degree in Data Science and Computer Engineering. It's a completly new project started from scratch but I will be using ideas and methods from my last project, wich it was a Java project for drones control using OpenCV aswell.

This time the drones will be controlled using the optical flow from theirs cameras allowing them to avoid obstacles, recognise objects or even builds maps of the enviroment.

GUI is QT based. The project is being made using VS 2017 with QT Tools.

...Working in progress...
